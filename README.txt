a few things:

 plotting is inefficient, also really bad
  re-namable boxes

 error catching custom box

math could probably more efficient ??

hover ports for value?
 color things semantically

a good way to edit i/o ports

  blocks:
   simple math block
   filter
   linear diffEQ
   UI (button, check, slider, wheel...

some kind of network link?

ARDUINO?!

data types: beat? color? image? audio?
 
 rendering context, for graphics, who knows; webGL?
 
  handling rendering context. more than one? render order? quartz-like?

MACRO PATCHES :G waat?!
  --this might be one of the next steps
 requires publishing i/o ports

framerate, etc controls?

data import/export


bug in exporting circularly-linked nodes: sometimes links are duplicated
